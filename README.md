# Trajectory_detection
This innovative solution leverages the power of RCNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks) to accurately track object trajectories in video frames. Our approach focuses on detecting objects and analyzing their movement frame-by-frame, providing precise tracking capabilities.
